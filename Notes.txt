Things to keep in mind while making the project.
These folder will be under research_and_analyst folder.
Add 5 folders - config, exception, logger, utils, routers, prompt_lib (under this folder prompts.py)

we will be creating a similar folder called template, static

Creating bankend server folder for backend code.
Under this folder will be having below files
__init__, schema, graph, workflow, models (Pydantic models)

UI will be created using javascript. (we should not really focus on UI, there will be separate UI team for that. Just focus on core concepts of GENAI)

Note - In GENAI interviews companies might ask you DSA questions as well. (It depends on company to company as well.)


# -----------------
Langgraph is very good for the orchestration
there is the difference orchestration and Multi Agent.
the advanced version of orchestration is Multi Agent (In this we are running everything in the loop connecting this agent with another agent).
99 % of the time, multi agentic architecture is not successful, it is very token consuming and it is also NOT giving good results.
